# TinyLS

This is a GUI Computer Program which is supposedly making link shortening easier by having an desktop app instead of going to the webpage of https://tinyurl.com
The way this program works, is by the user entering a URL and a custom Alias.
After that, it insert those values into the link of https://tinyurl.com/create.php?alias={alias}&url={url}
Then, the link is created provided no errors occur.

I take credit for the code as well as the images.
Apart from that, this was coded in Python with tkinter library as well as some attempt to use classes

This is generally just a mini project I worked on to improve my tkinter and OOP Programming as well as deployment.
Though Windows Defender marks this as a Potentially Unwanted Program, I assure you that it is safe, you may check on VirusTotal!

Enjoy!
