# TinyLS

This is a GUI Computer Program which is supposedly making link shortening easier by having an desktop app instead of going to the webpage of https://tinyurl.com
The way this program works, is by the user entering a URL and a custom Alias.
After that, it insert those values into the link of https://tinyurl.com/create.php?alias={alias}&url={url}
Then, the link is created provided no errors occur.

This is generally just a mini project in python I worked on to improve my tkinter and OOP Programming as well as deployment.

For the original version made in python, it can be found [here](https://github.com/NicholasJohansan/TinyLS/tree/master).

This has now been remade with HTML, CSS and JS with jQuery and Tauri
